# python-pagerduty
Python library supplying client classes for PagerDuty's public APIs.

This repository is a work in progress. Its intention is to eventually replace [pdpyras](https://github.com/PagerDuty/pdpyras) as the de-facto standard Python client for PagerDuty. Its name in PyPI will be `pagerduty`, although the moderators must approve our name transferral request first: [pypi/support#3589](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/3589).
